# Drawn Tests

## Motivation

The recently concluded England-India Test Series, which England clinched 4-1 at The Oval was the third test series in a row without a drawn match (Sri Lanka v South Africa and Bangladesh v West Indies being the two that preceded it). This leads to an interesting thought: are drawn test matches disappearing from the modern game?

## Initial Thoughts

It seems like the case for this being the golden age for results in test cricket (i.e. games won by either side) is strong. Interest in test cricket is dwindling, thanks to the franchise T20 epidemic. In order to regurgitate an interest in test cricket, curators are perhaps creating pitches that either favour the hosts - leading to more home wins - or pitches that offer a good contest between bat and ball - leading to an increased likelihood of obtaining a result.
